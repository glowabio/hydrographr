\title{Get upstream and downstream network buffer along stream segments}
\usage{
get_buffer_along_the_network(
  lines_sf,
  target_ids = NULL,
  start_points = NULL,
  up_radius = 0,
  down_radius = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lines_sf}{An `sf` object representing the stream network. Must have
columns `subc_id`, `target`, `length`, and LINESTRING geometry.}

\item{target_ids}{Optional vector of segment IDs to start from (exclusive with start_points)}

\item{start_points}{Optional sf POINT object to start from (exclusive with target_ids)}

\item{up_radius}{Numeric distance to traverse upstream (default 0)}

\item{down_radius}{Numeric distance to traverse downstream (default 0)}
}
\value{
An sf object containing all segments within requested distances.
  Columns include:
  - `point_id`: identifier of starting point
  - `target_segment`: segment used as starting point
  - `start_fraction`: fraction along starting segment
  - `direction`: "upstream" or "downstream"
  - `search_distance`: requested buffer distance
}
\description{
Extracts all segments along a stream network within specified upstream
and/or downstream distances from either segment IDs or sf points.
