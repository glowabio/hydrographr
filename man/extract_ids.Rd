\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame or data.table with lat/lon coordinates in WGS84}

\item{lon}{character. The name of the column with the longitude coordinates}

\item{lat}{character. The name of the column with the latitude coordinates}

\item{id}{character. The name of a column containing unique IDs for each row
of "data" (e.g., occurrence or site IDs)}

\item{basin_layer}{character. Full path to the basin ID .tif layer}

\item{subc_layer}{character. Full path to the sub-catchment ID .tif layer}

\item{quiet}{logical. If FALSE, the standard output will be printed.
Default is TRUE.}

\description{
Extracts the ID value of the basin and/or sub-catchment raster layer at a
given point location.
}
\details{
For the extraction of a value at a given point location from the basin
and/or sub-catchment raster layer of the Hydrography90m dataset, the GDAL
function 'gdallocationinfo' is used. The point locations have to be defined
by coordinates of the WGS84 reference system. The function can also be used
to extract any value from a given raster layer with a WGS84 projection, such
as e.g. environmental information that is stored in the input raster file.

Duplicated rows will be removed.
