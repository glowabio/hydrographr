extract_ids(
  data,
  lon,
  lat,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame with lat/lon coordinates in WGS84.}

\item{lon}{Column name of longitude coordinates as character vector.}

\item{lat}{Column name of latitude coordinates as character vector.}

\item{site_id}{Column name of a unique ID as character vector; Optional
an ID for the point location can be defined.}

\item{basin_path}{Full path to the basin ID .tif layer.}

\item{subc_path}{Full path to the sub-catchment ID .tif layer.}

\item{quiet}{Whether the standard output will be printed or not.}
}
\description{
Extracts the ID value of the basin and/or sub-catchment raster layer at a
given point location.
}
\details{
For the extraction of a value at a given point location from the basin
and/or sub-catchment raster layer of the Hydrography90m the GDAL function
'gdallocationinfo' is used. The point locations have to be defined by
coordinates of the WGS84 reference system, it can be used to extract any
value from a given raster layer with a WGS84 projection.
