\usage{
get_distance(
  data,
  lon,
  lat,
  id,
  basin_id = NULL,
  basin_layer = NULL,
  stream_layer = NULL,
  distance = "both",
  n_cores = 1,
  quiet = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame or data.table with lat/lon coordinates in WGS84.}

\item{lon}{character. The name of the column with the longitude coordinates.}

\item{lat}{character. The name of the column with the latitude coordinates.}

\item{id}{character. The name of a column containing unique IDs for each row
of "data" (e.g., occurrence or site IDs).}

\item{basin_id}{character. The name of the column with the basin IDs.
If NULL and distance is set to 'network' or 'both', the basin IDs will be
extracted automatically. Default is NULL.}

\item{basin_layer}{character. Full path to the basin ID .tif layer. Needs to
be defined to calculate the distance along the network.}

\item{stream_layer}{character. Full path of the stream network .gpkg file.
Needs to be defined to calculate the distance along the network.}

\item{distance}{character. One of "euclidean", "network", or "both".
If "euclidean", the euclidean distances between all pairs of points are
calculated. If "network", the shortest path along the network between all
pairs of points is calculated. (see "Details" for more information).
If method is set to "both", both distance measures are calculated.
Distances are given in meters. Default is "both".}

\item{n_cores}{numeric. Number of cores used for parallelization.
Default is 1.}

\item{quiet}{logical. If FALSE, the standard output will be printed.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
If distance='euclidean', a distance matrix, in meters, of the euclidean distances between
all the pairs of points (object of class data.frame). If distance='network',
a data.frame with three columns: from_id, to_id, dist. The 'dist' column
includes the distance, in meters, of the shortest path along the network from the node
from_id to the node to_id. If distance='both', a list containing both objects
is returned.

\description{
Calculate euclidean or along the network distance between points. To calculate
the distance along the network, point coordinates need to be snapped to the
stream network using the function \code{\link{snap_to_network}} or
\code{\link{snap_to_subc_segment}}.
}
\details{
To calculate the euclidian distance between all pair of points the function
uses the v.distance command of GRASS GIS, which has been set up to produce a
square matrix of distances. The calculation of distances along the stream
network has been implemented with the command v.net.allpairs of GRASS GIS.
The along the network distance calculation is done for all pair points
located within the same basin. If the points are located in
different basins the function can be run in parallel (i.e., each core for
the distance calculations of all points within one basin). The
distance between points located in different
basins is zero because they are not connected through the network.
