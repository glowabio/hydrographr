\title{Extract partial stream network needed for snapped points}
\usage{
extract_partial_stream_network(
  stream,
  snapped_subcs,
  strahler_retain_threshold = 4,
  upstream_buffer = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stream}{sf object with columns:
`subc_id`, `target`, `strahler_order`, and LINESTRING geometry.}

\item{snapped_subcs}{integer vector: subc_ids after snapping.}

\item{strahler_retain_threshold}{integer: minimum Strahler to fully retain (default 4).}

\item{upstream_buffer}{integer: how many same-Strahler upstream segments to retain.}
}
\value{
sf object containing the partial stream network.
}
\description{
Given a stream network and snapped point subcatchments, this returns the
reduced stream network consisting of:
- All segments with Strahler order >= `strahler_retain_threshold`
- All downstream paths from finer-order snapped segments until reaching
  a segment with Strahler >= `strahler_retain_threshold`
- PLUS a configurable number of *upstream* same-Strahler segments for context
}
