\title{Read a GeoPackage file}
\usage{
read_geopackage(gpkg, import_as = "data.table", layer_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gpkg}{character. Full path of the GeoPackage file.}

\item{import_as}{character. "data.table", "graph", "sf", or "SpatVect".
"data.table" imports data as a data.table. "graph" imports the layer as a
directed graph (igraph object). This option is only possible for a network
layer (e.g. the stream network). "sf" imports the layer as a  spatial data
frame (sf object). "SpatVect" imports the layer as a SpatVector (terra
object). Default is "data.table".}

\item{layer_name}{character. Name of the specific data layer to import from
the GeoPackage. A specific data layer only needs to be defined if the
GeoPackage contains multiple layers. To see the available layers the function
st_layers() from the R package 'sf' can be used. Optional. Default is NULL.}
}
\description{
Reads a GeoPackage vector file from disk either as a table
(data.table), as a directed graph object (igraph), a spatial dataframe (sf)
or a SpatVect object (terra).
