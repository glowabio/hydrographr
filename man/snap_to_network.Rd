\usage{
snap_to_network(
  data,
  lon,
  lat,
  id,
  stream_layer,
  accu_layer = NULL,
  method = "distance",
  distance = 500,
  accumulation = 0.5,
  quiet = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame or data.table with lat/lon coordinates in WGS84.}

\item{lon}{character. The name of the column with the longitude coordinates.}

\item{lat}{character. The name of the column with the latitude coordinates.}

\item{id}{character. The name of a column containing unique IDs for
each row of "data" (e.g., occurrence or site IDs). The unique IDs need to be
numeric.}

\item{stream_layer}{character. Full path of the stream network .tif file}

\item{accu_layer}{character. Full path of the flow accumulation .tif file.
Needed if the point should be snapped to the next stream segment having
an accumulation value higher than the flow accumulation threshold
(set by 'accumulation'). This prevents points from being snapped to small
stream tributaries.}

\item{method}{character. One of "distance", "accumulation", or "both".
Defines if the points are snapped using the distance or flow accumulation
(see "Details" for more information). If method is set to "both" the output
will contain the new coordinates for both calculations.
Default is "distance".}

\item{distance}{numeric. Maximum radius in pixels. The points will be
snapped to the next stream within this radius. Default is 500.}

\item{accumulation}{numeric. Minimum flow accumulation. Points will be
snapped to the next stream with a flow accumulation equal or higher than the
given value. Default is 0.5.}

\item{quiet}{logical. If FALSE, the standard output will be printed.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame with the snapped coordinates and the sub-catchment ID
of the snapped stream segment. If the sub-catchment ID is NA, no stream segment
was found within the given distance (method = "distance") or no stream segment
wad found within the given distance and a flow accumulation equal or higher
than the given threshold (method = "accumulation"). "out-bbox" means that the
provided coordinates are not within the extend (bounding box) of the
provided stream network layer.
}
\description{
Snap points to the next stream segment within a defined radius
or a minimum flow accumulation.
}
\details{
The function makes use of the r.stream.snap command available in GRASS GIS to
simultaneously a number of points to a stream network. A distance threshold
can be specified and points will be snapped to any stream segment within this
distance radius. However, to avoid snapping to small tributaries, an
accumulation threshold can be used and the snapping occurs on stream segment
with equal or higher accumulation threshold and within the given distance
radius.
