\title{Trace N upstream steps from a subcatchment}
\usage{
trace_upstream_n(start_id, df, steps)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_id}{Integer. The starting subcatchment ID.}

\item{df}{A data.frame or tibble containing at least the columns
`subc_id` and `target`.}

\item{steps}{Integer. Maximum number of upstream levels to traverse.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of subcatchment IDs traced upstream.
}
\description{
Internal helper function. Starting from a given subcatchment ID, this
function walks upstream through all parent segments (those for which
`target == start_id`) for a fixed number of recursive steps. This is useful
for including contextual upstream segments near fine-order snapped points.
