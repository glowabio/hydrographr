\title{Traverse downstream along a stream network}
\usage{
traverse_downstream(lines_sf, segment_id, start_fraction, max_distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{lines_sf}{An `sf` object representing the stream network with columns
`subc_id`, `target`, and `length`.}

\item{segment_id}{Character or numeric. The starting segment ID.}

\item{start_fraction}{Numeric between 0 and 1. The fractional position along
the starting segment (0 = start of segment, 1 = end of segment).}

\item{max_distance}{Numeric. Maximum distance to traverse downstream (in the
same units as `length` column in `lines_sf`).}
}
\value{
A list of segment information, where each element contains:
  \item{subc_id}{Segment ID}
  \item{fraction_start}{Starting fraction along the segment}
  \item{fraction_end}{Ending fraction along the segment}
  \item{length_used}{Length of segment used in the traversal}
}
\description{
Starting from a given segment and position along that segment, this function
traverses downstream along the network for a specified distance, collecting
all segments (or partial segments) encountered.
}
\details{
The function follows the network downstream (using the `target` column)
until either the maximum distance is reached or there are no more downstream
segments. Partial segments are included if the distance budget is exhausted
partway through a segment.
