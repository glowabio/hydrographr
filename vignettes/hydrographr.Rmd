## Loading `hydrographr`

You can install `hydrographr` from its GitHub repository. If you did not install the `R` package yet, install it with `remotes::install_github()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# If the package remotes is not installed run first:
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("glowabio/hydrographr")
```

Before we start exploring the package load `hydrographr`.

```{r}
library(hydrographr)
```
