## Installation of the required GIS tools

If you do not have installed any of the GIS tools, please, install before using `hydrographr`. If you use Ubuntu you can copy-paste the commands below. If you use another Linux distribution, please, see the linked software webpage below for installation instruction.


**Add the Ubuntugis repository**

First, you have to add the "Ubuntugis" Personal Package Archive (PPA) to your system's software sources to be able to install the GIS tools available from there.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Add the Ubuntugis PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
```

Next, you need to tell your system to pull down the latest list of software from each archive it knows about, including the PPA you just added:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Update the packages list
sudo apt update
```

Now you are ready to install  `GDAL`, `pktools` and `GRASS GIS`. Copy and paste the commands below into your console and follow the instructions to install the tools.

**GDAL**

GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats and comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing. For more information check the [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) website.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Install GDAL
sudo apt install gdal-bin python3-gdal
```

**pktools**

Pktools is a suite of command line utilities for image processing and remote sensing applications written in C++. For more information check the [pktools](https://pktools.nongnu.org/html/index.html) website.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Install pktools
sudo apt install pktools
```

**GRASS GIS**

GRASS GIS is a powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing engine including tools for terrain and ecosystem modeling, hydrology and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. For more detailed installation instructions check the [GRASS GIS users wiki](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Installation_Guide#Ubuntu) or the [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) website.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Install GRASS GIS
sudo apt-get install grass grass-core grass-dev grass-gui grass-doc
```

**GRASS GIS addons**

Copy-paste the commands below to install the required addons for GRASS GIS.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt install make

# Install GRASS GIS addons
export GRASSEXEC="grass --exec"
$GRASSEXEC  g.extension  extension=r.stream.distance
$GRASSEXEC  g.extension  extension=r.stream.order
$GRASSEXEC  g.extension  extension=r.stream.snap
$GRASSEXEC  g.extension  extension=r.stream.basins
```
