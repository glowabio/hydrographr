`hydrographr` provides a collection of `R` function wrappers for GDAL and GRASS-GIS functions to efficiently work with Hydrography90m spatial data. The package is currently under development. More and more useful functions will be made available over time here. 

Installation
-----------
```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glowabio/hydrographr")
library(hydrographr)
```

The package is currently being developed and we invite users to test the functions and report issues as well as feature requests.
