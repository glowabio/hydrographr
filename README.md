[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`hydrographr` provides a collection of `R` function wrappers for GDAL and GRASS-GIS functions to efficiently work with [Hydrography90m](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4525/2022/essd-14-4525-2022.html) and spatial biodiversity data. The easy-to-use functions process large raster and vector data directly on disk in parallel, such that the memory of R does not get overloaded. This allows creating scalable data processing and analysis workflows in R, even though the data is not processed directly in R.

We will add more functions and a vignette over time, and we invite users to test the package. Please notify us of any possible issues, bugs and feature requests under the [issues tab](https://github.com/glowabio/hydrographr/issues) on the top of this page.

Installation
-----------
Please see the installation guide of the required tools at https://glowabio.github.io/hydrographr/articles/hydrographr.html. Afterwards, use the following lines to install the package in R:

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glowabio/hydrographr")
library(hydrographr)
```
The pdf manual of the `hydrographr` package can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/glowabio/hydrographr/tree/main/man/pdf/hydrographr_1.0.14.pdf).

We thank [NFDI4Biodiversity](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/en/) and [NFDI4Earth](https://www.nfdi4earth.de/) for providing the funding that helped us getting the hydrographr package together!
